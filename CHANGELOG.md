## [0.0.1.0] - 2026-07-19

### Added

- `docs/field-audit-checklist.md` — the consumer-side field-audit runbook:
  how to run a one-day friction audit inside any consumer repo behind an IP
  wall, classify each friction with the two-leg deferral test into the
  pay-now bins, and relay only de-identified, pattern-shaped findings back.
  Includes IP-wall guardrails (no verbatim consumer text, raw log stays
  behind the wall, identifiability self-check) and a worked relay entry.
